## Installation

LichessHelper is available on the [Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/LichessHelper-improve-chess/kdkckejnngdmlcephpnfaggaeofloode/), [Firefox Web Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/LichessHelper/) and [Microsoft Edge Store](#ms). Visit the store page and click on the "Add" button to install the extension directly to your browser.

You can also download the latest version of LichessHelper Extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/LichessHelper/LichessHelper/releases) page. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions provided.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, follow these steps to start working with it:

1. **Activation:** Open Lichess.org in your browser (better on /game page, so you can see the board & pieces changes).
2. **Extension Access:** Click on the LichessHelper Extension icon in the browser toolbar to activate it.
3. **Customization:** Access the extension options to start customizing according to your preference. Each setting saves even after cleaning the cache, so don't worry about it.
4. **Enjoy!** Sit back, relax, and enjoy your personalized Lichess.org experience. I spent a good amount of time just to make it work well. So it should work well. If not, then let me know and I'll fix it!
